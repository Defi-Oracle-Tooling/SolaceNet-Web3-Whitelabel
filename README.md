# SolaceNet Web3 Whitelabel

A white-label Web3/Web4 banking gateway with one-click deployment to GitHub and automated CI/CD pipelines for Microsoft Azure deployments.

## Overview

This repository allows users to deploy a Web3/Web4 banking gateway with automated CI/CD pipelines for deployment to Microsoft Azure in single or multi-region configurations. The repository supports both centralized and decentralized banking deployments.

## Key Components

### Tech Stack
- Backend Services: @tatumio/tatum SDK for accounts & transactions
- Authentication: @webauth SDK for user authentication
- Smart Contracts: OpenZeppelin (RBAC without owner, UUPS upgradeable)
- Frontend: React with Next.js
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing & deployments
- Hosting: Microsoft Azure (App Services, Functions, Blob Storage, Key Vault)
- Database: Azure CosmosDB / PostgreSQL (configurable)

### Deployment Models
- Centralized (Standard Banking): Single Azure region
- Decentralized (Distributed Nodes): Multi-region deployment with redundant services

## Deployment Flow

### One-Click GitHub Deployment
1. User clicks "Deploy to GitHub" (GitHub Actions App/Template Repo Fork)
2. User selects a GitHub account/repo to clone the white-label repository
3. GitHub Actions runs initial setup:
   - Prompts for configuration (Single-region or Multi-region)
   - Requests Azure credentials (via GitHub Secrets)
   - Requests Tatum.io & WebAuth API keys
   - Sets up database connection
4. Automatic Branch Protection & Webhook Configuration:
   - Protects main branch from direct commits
   - Sets up CI/CD workflows
   - Configures GitHub Actions for Azure deployments

### CI/CD Process

#### Centralized Deployment (Single-Region)
1. Push to GitHub → GitHub Actions trigger CI/CD
2. Build Process:
   - Linting & code analysis
   - Run backend & frontend tests
   - Compile smart contracts (if applicable)
3. Deployment Process:
   - Deploy backend services to Azure App Services
   - Deploy smart contracts (if applicable)
   - Deploy frontend to Azure Static Web Apps
   - Sync with Tatum.io Virtual Accounts
4. Verify Deployment:
   - Run post-deployment tests
   - Notify via Slack/Discord (if configured)

#### Decentralized Deployment (Multi-Region)
1. Push to GitHub → Multi-Region CI/CD Triggered
2. Parallel Deployment Process:
   - Deploy backend services to multiple Azure regions
   - Distribute smart contract instances across chains
   - Sync regional deployments with load balancer & global database replication
3. Multi-Region Verification:
   - Health checks & failover simulation
   - Sync ledger updates & database replications

## Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|

## Security & Compliance
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using OpenZeppelin
- Azure Key Vault for secret management
- CI/CD security checks for vulnerabilities & compliance
- DDoS protection via Azure's firewall services
- Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for user identity verification
